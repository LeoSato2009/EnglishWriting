Agree or disagree:
Movies and TV programs have more negative influence than positive on how young people behave.

I disagree with this opinion. I have two main reasons to support my opinion.
First, watching the contents of movies and TV programs makes young people behave funny. For example, entertainment which movies and TV programs have influences young people to think more creatively, thus they come to tell more exciting things and they will be able to give good feelings such as excitement and happiness to people around them. 
Second, they will be kind by watching their own culture’s introduction. For instance, many cultures are introduced in TV programs, and they have an individual feature. In Japan, the thinking of “Omotenasi” is cherished and it is said that to be kind to other people is important. Consequently watching TV programs and knowing own culture lets people to do good behavior.
Therefore I think movies and TV programs have more positive influence than negative on how young people behave.
