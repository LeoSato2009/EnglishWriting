Should governments work together to increase global food production?

Yes, I think governments should work together to increase food production. Ihave two main reasons to support my opinion.
 First, other countries have more wide land space than Japan. If we have connection with other countries, we can spread the area to make some Japanese crops, so we’ll be able to grow them efficientlly and we can increase food production.
 Second, we will be able to share high technologies. Japan has good technology to produce crops, but we’ve shared this technology to other little country. Therefore, if we get connection with other country more and make it more strong, we’ll be able to make crops faster.
 To help each other and rely on each strong points will makes producing crops efficiently, therefore I think government should work together to increase grobal food production.
