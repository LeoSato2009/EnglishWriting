# English Writing - Language Skill Improvement Project -

## 1. Project Overview

This project is an educational initiative aimed at gradually improving writing ability and overall English language skills through essay writing at the EIKEN Pre-1 level and an iterative cycle of evaluation and revision using AI (ChatGPT). Teaching materials and operational files are organized in a GitHub repository and on Google Drive. (\[GitHub])

---

## 2. Purpose and Background

* **Educational Purpose**: To improve the learner’s ability in idea development, structure, vocabulary, and grammar at the EIKEN Pre-1 level, and to foster self-editing skills rather than merely providing model answers.
* **Background**: Emphasis is placed on establishing a habitual learning practice where learners practically incorporate feedback by running short, regular cycles of evaluation → reflection → re-creation. (Relevant files are located within the repository.) (\[GitHub])

---

## 3. Implementation Method

1. **Prepare the Initial Prompt**

   * Instructors review the AI prompt defined in `prompt.txt` (in the repository) and adjust it as needed to align with learning objectives and scoring criteria. (\[GitHub])

2. **Essay Creation (Learner)**

   * Learners create a first draft on the assigned theme (essay drafts are managed in files such as `writing01/writing01.txt`). (\[GitHub])

3. **AI Evaluation (ChatGPT, etc.)**

   * Using the specified prompt, AI evaluates the first draft and outputs scores, comments, and improvement suggestions. Evaluation items are broken down by aspects such as "Organization," "Coherence," "Vocabulary," "Grammar," and "Task Fulfillment" (an evaluation sheet is used).

4. **Review the Evaluation Sheet and Instructor Feedback**

   * Instructors review the AI output and, where necessary, refine the evaluation criteria or add focused guidance points. Combining AI evaluation with human instruction helps prevent misjudgments and oversights.

5. **Revision and Rewriting**

   * Learners revise their drafts based on feedback and create updated versions. The same cycle is repeated to record the trajectory of improvement.

6. **Recording and Analysis**

   * Scores and correction points from each cycle are accumulated to analyze learning effects quantitatively (score trends) and qualitatively (types of frequent errors).

## 4. Materials & Reference Links

* **GitHub Repository (Project Main)**: [LeoSato2009/EnglishWriting](https://github.com/LeoSato2009/EnglishWriting/)
  The repository contains files such as `prompt.txt`, `writing01/`, and others.

* **Key Files (within the repository)**:

  * `prompt.txt` (AI evaluation prompt) — [link](https://github.com/LeoSato2009/EnglishWriting/blob/main/prompt.txt)
  * `writing01/writing01.txt` (example learner first draft) — [link](https://github.com/LeoSato2009/EnglishWriting/blob/main/writing01/writing01.txt)
  * `writing/writing01_correction.md` (example corrections by AI/instructor) — [link](https://github.com/LeoSato2009/EnglishWriting/blob/main/writing/writing01_correction.md)

## 5. Outcomes and Expected Benefits

* **Skill Consolidation through Repetition**: By repeatedly performing quick cycles of evaluation → revision → re-creation, learners are expected to steadily improve their expression choices and structural skills.
* **Introduction of Objective Evaluation**: AI’s initial evaluations can consistently apply scoring criteria and are useful for obtaining quantitative comparisons (score trends). However, because misjudgments are possible, learners should always perform a final human review.
* **Learning Environment without Instructors**: Utilizing AI as an assistive tool helps with routine grading tasks and enables effective skill development even when no instructor is present.
* **Data-Driven Curriculum Improvement**: Analyzing accumulated error data and score trends makes it possible to identify student weaknesses (e.g., tense misuse, use of conjunctions, paragraph structure issues) and scientifically revise problem areas.

## 6. Notes on Use

* AI outputs are supplementary; **final evaluation and learning policy decisions should be made by humans (the learner or instructor)**.
* Handle external file links (GitHub, Drive, etc.) with appropriate care.
