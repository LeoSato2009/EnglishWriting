Agree or disagree:
A job with more vacation time is better than a job with high salary but less vacation time.

I agree with this opinion. I have two main reasons to support my opinion.
First, having more vacation time help workers keep their family’s relationship good. For example, if workers have plenty of vacation time, they can spend a lot with their family and do many things such as play with their kids and take their families to far places for travel. Therefore families feel amuse and workers can maintain their relationship.
Second, vacation will play another important role in economy. For instance, there are general thinking that more and more working can earn a lot of money, but that is wrong. By taking vacation can relax worker’s body and mental, so workers can earn a lot of money efficiently and they can help their family’s life in cost.
Consequently, I think a job with more vacation time is better than a job with high salary but less vacation time.
