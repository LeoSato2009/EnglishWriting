Agree or disagree:
Being creative, rather than carefully planning more often results in the best solution of a problem.

I agree with this opinion. I have two main reasons to support my opinion.
First, being creative can generate better ideas regardless of the quality of education. For example, in carefully planning projects, they will have to deal numerical data, so they need people who had taken advanced quality of education. However in creative projects, it need not to deal numbers, so various kinds of people can attend to the projects, thus it enable to create good ideas high possibility.
Second, people in the projects can take the communication each other more various. For instance, being creative can make their mind multi directions, therefore they do not stay in stereotype. In addition they can talk many kinds of topics, so they can enjoy conversation and they can keep the motivation high.
Consequently, I think being creative, rather than carefully planning more often results in the best solution of a problem.
